For instance, Uniswap, ENS, Lens Protocol etc. are channels on Push Protocol that you can opt-in to.\\n- Notifications: Notifications are alerts from any of the channels that user opts-in to. For example, loan liquidation alerts, new governance proposals, ENS domain name expiry or web3 news updates.\\n\\n—-Web3 users often interact with a plethora of decentralized applications (dapps) ranging from DeFi tools, to NFT marketplaces to media channels. With so many dapps, staying updated often demands constant attention and regular logins, resulting in an overwhelming user experience.\\n\\nThe Push Snap aims to resolve this issue by bringing all essential updates for the user directly into their MetaMask wallet. This eliminates the need to bounce between multiple web3 applications as the user's MetaMask wallet now acts as a unified notification center for all imperative web3 updates.\\n\\nGet Started in 4-Simple Steps\\n\\n1. Installation: Click on 'Add to MetaMask' button shown above. This initiates the process of adding the Push Snap to your MetaMask wallet.\\n2. Setting-Up Push Snap: Once installed, you should be prompted to visit Push dapp, i.e., https://app.push.org/snap. Visit the dApp to proceed with next steps.\\n3. Adding your Address: Once connected to the dapp, the Snap will require confirmation to add your address. Adding of address in the Snap means enabling your wallet to receive notifications.\\n4. Opt-In to Channels: Once address is added, simply click on Get Started. This takes you to https://app.push.org/channels wherein you can opt-in to any of your favorite channels to receive real-time notifications.\\n\\nVideo Walk-through\\n\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LjPxKoYLiGs\\n\\nAdditional Features of Push Snap\\n\\n1.

The EAS Snap converts this data into a clear, readable format.

For instance, Uniswap, ENS, Lens Protocol etc. are channels on Push Protocol that you can opt-in to.\n- Notifications: Notifications are alerts from any of the channels that user opts-in to. For example, loan liquidation alerts, new governance proposals, ENS domain name expiry or web3 news updates.\n\n—-Web3 users often interact with a plethora of decentralized applications (dapps) ranging from DeFi tools, to NFT marketplaces to media channels. With so many dapps, staying updated often demands constant attention and regular logins, resulting in an overwhelming user experience.\n\nThe Push Snap aims to resolve this issue by bringing all essential updates for the user directly into their MetaMask wallet. This eliminates the need to bounce between multiple web3 applications as the user's MetaMask wallet now acts as a unified notification center for all imperative web3 updates.\n\nGet Started in 4-Simple Steps\n\n1. Installation: Click on 'Add to MetaMask' button shown above. This initiates the process of adding the Push Snap to your MetaMask wallet.\n2. Setting-Up Push Snap: Once installed, you should be prompted to visit Push dapp, i.e., https://app.push.org/snap. Visit the dApp to proceed with next steps.\n3. Adding your Address: Once connected to the dapp, the Snap will require confirmation to add your address. Adding of address in the Snap means enabling your wallet to receive notifications.\n4.

It decodes attestation data, allowing users to clearly understand and verify the details before confirming a transaction.\n\nWhy It Matters\nWhen signing attestations with MetaMask, the data often appears in a hexadecimal format, which is not human-readable. The EAS Snap converts this data into a clear, readable format. This ensures you're fully aware of the attestation's details, mitigating the risk of unintentional or malicious signings.\n\nKey Features\n- Attestation Decoding: Utilizes SchemaEncoder from the EAS SDK to decode attestation data, presenting it in a readable format.\n- Transaction Data Parsing: The snap parses Ethereum transaction data to identify if it is related to an EAS attestation, using ethers library.\n- Dynamic Content Rendering: It dynamically renders transaction details in the MetaMask UI, including schema, recipient, reference UID, expiration time, and revocability status, offering users a complete overview of the attestation they are about to sign.\n- Time Formatting: Utilizes dayjs with extended formats to display expiration times in a user-friendly manner.\n- GraphQL Integration: Communicates with EAS's GraphQL endpoint to fetch and display the schema associated with the attestation.\n- Data Decoding and Display: Decodes and displays each piece of attestation data using the fetched schema, allowing users to understand the specifics of what they are attesting.\n\nAfter installing the Snap, you can view insights in the transaction flow while interacting with an EAS contract.

Using this Snap, users of accounts, inside MetaMask, would still have pure self-custody (all key shards are under user control and possession), while the key shards are distributed between their browser wallet and phone. \n\nSilent Shard enables an experience where the user is requested to approve transactions on their paired phone. This brings the user flow of the web3 wallet closer and more conforming to conventional 2FA, which is well accepted in traditional internet banking and fintech applications. \n\nThe Snap supports features like instant backup and recovery, and transaction security insights are to come. You can now bid goodbye to a seed phrase as a single point of failure and enjoy a fully decentralised experience."},{"snapId":"npm:@safeheron/mpcsnap","name":"Safeheron","summary":"A fully decentralized MPC wallet with three key shards distributed across the MetaMask Extension and two mobile phones with the Safeheron Snap App installed.

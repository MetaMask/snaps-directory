Store your credentials locally or on Ceramic Network and receive/share data over popular identity protocols, such as OID4VC and Polygon ID. This makes Masca a truly universal identity solution, perfect for Web3 explorers and non-Web3 native users. Any website can connect to Masca to access identity data, and dapp developers can already start with the integration!\n\nAfter installing the Snap, visit the website to manage your decentralized identity.","trusted":true},"latestVersion":"1.0.0","website":"https://masca.io/app","onboard":null,"category":"interoperability","author":{"name":"Blockchain Lab:UM","website":"https://blockchain-lab.um.si/?lang=en"},"sourceCode":"https://github.com/blockchain-lab-um/masca","audits":[{"auditor":"Least Authority","report":"https://leastauthority.com/blog/audits/audit-of-masca-metamask-snap/"}],"banner":{"publicURL":"/static/2bdf75eefe0238f1986be3b53df1d1b0/banner.png"},"support":{"contact":"https://discord.gg/M5xgNz7TTF","faq":null,"knowledgeBase":"https://docs.masca.io/"}},"site":{"siteMetadata":{"title":"MetaMask Snaps Directory","description":"Explore community-built Snaps to customize your web3 experience via our official directory.","author":"MetaMask","siteUrl":"https://snaps.metamask.io"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"7903556c-86df-59fd-ba36-7924814f7097","location":"npm","slug":"@blockchain-lab-um/masca","__params":{"location":"npm","slug":"blockchain-lab-um"}}},"staticQueryHashes":["1327515118","2348971465"],"slicesMap":{}}
